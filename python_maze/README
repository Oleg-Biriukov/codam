Alright. Here is a clear, defensible plan for Teammate A, without code, focused specifically on the algorithmic part, so that during the defense it is clear what exactly they did and what they were responsible for.

📘 Work Plan — Teammate A
Role: Core Maze Generation & Structure

---

### 1. Project Requirements Analysis

Break down what a maze is in terms of the project:

* grid of cells
* 4 possible walls (N / E / S / W)

Define invariants:

* walls between neighboring cells are always consistent
* no out-of-bounds access outside the maze

Understand the difference between:

* perfect maze
* non-perfect maze

---

### 2. Designing the Internal Maze Structure

Describe the logical model:

* what a cell is
* how walls are stored
* how cells are connected to each other

Define which data must be accessible externally:

* dimensions
* access to walls
* ability to iterate over cells

Ensure independence from:

* output file format
* visualization method

---

### 3. Choosing and Justifying the Generation Algorithm

Select a maze generation algorithm:

* recursive backtracker / Prim / other

Explain:

* why this specific algorithm
* how it guarantees maze connectivity

Consider:

* how randomness is ensured
* how seed works for reproducibility

---

### 4. Implementing Maze Generation

Build the generation process:

* starting cell
* rules for moving between cells
* opening walls

Ensure:

* no isolated cells
* correct boundary handling

Take into account requirements:

* PERFECT = True / False

---

### 5. Wall Consistency Control

Ensure the rule:

* if there is no wall between two cells, it is reflected on both sides

Design a verification mechanism:

* after generation
* or during generation

Prevent inconsistent data states

---

### 6. Limiting Open Areas

Analyze what counts as a “large open area”

Develop an approach for:

* detecting fully open 3×3 areas
* preventing their creation

Ensure corridors:

* do not exceed the allowed width

Integrate this either into generation or as a post-check

---

### 7. Preparing for “42” Pattern Insertion

Ensure the ability to:

* fully close selected cells

Without breaking:

* the maze structure
* other cells

Leave room for:

* further maze re-validation

---

### 8. Generator API

Clearly define:

* how the generator is created
* what parameters it accepts

Describe:

* how generation is triggered
* how the maze structure is retrieved

Provide a stable contract for Teammate B

---

### 9. Error Handling and Edge Cases

Anticipate:

* a maze that is too small
* inability to satisfy all constraints

Ensure:

* clear error messages
* no crashes

---

### 10. Documentation and Defense Preparation

Explain:

* how the algorithm works step by step
* what guarantees it provides

Be ready to answer:

* why the maze is always valid
* what happens when parameters change

Describe your role in the README:

> “Responsible for maze generation and structure”

---

✅ Definition of Done (for Teammate A)

* The generator creates a valid maze
* All subject constraints are respected
* The maze is independent from UI and output
* Teammate A can explain every step of the algorithm
